Be the judge,<br>    Judge you must<br>    But judge just,<br>    Don’t throw away what’s mine what’s yours what’s ours what’s us, Don’t tear down what’s built,<br>    Don’t kill the trust,<br>    tearing down you must<br>    to create,<br>    what is your choice,<br>    endless rest<br>    or a rest with an end,<br>    come closer, don’t push me away again, I have to run<br>    But I want to stay,<br>    feverish dreams, shaking and wondering, wake up, this is not a dream,<br>    too real it seems,<br>    bring me back to this place which we once knew, that place, which fanned the fire,<br>    which cursed me to be yours forever,<br>    which blessed me which the deepest depths, memories fade, yet they are all that’s left, please lay your head once more on my chest,<br>    let the flame not smother,<br>    and stay my spark,<br>    at the end only you decide what to do with that heart<br></p>
