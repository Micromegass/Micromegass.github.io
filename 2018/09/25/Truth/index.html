Enjoy pleasures!<br>    I’ll place my arms around your bitter, sweet soul,<br>    See! Love exists!<br><br>    Love is a mirage, love is never true,<br>    what is true will never be unveiled,<br>    unsheath your sword and do not fight,<br>    there is nothing worth fighting for…<br>    I’ll fight for you;<br>    I’ll drown myself to make you breathe,<br>    I’ll make God disappear, so you believe,<br>    I’ll hate the world so you can love,<br>    embed myself in stone so you can fly off,<br>    I will bow my head so you can stand above…<br><br>    Don’t believe me, go, be on your way!<br>    Hear my screams, begging you to stay,<br>    I’ll fight your wars so you can live in peace,<br>    I’ll beg for no one and nothing; stay…please…<br><br>    Think freely!

I am stone, earth, wind, water, fire and rust.<br><br>    I need you as you need me<br>    There is no need for us to be,<br>    Look for the answers, you cannot find them, nowhere!<br>    Know what you want,<br>    it’s best to want nothing at all,<br>    your head is heavy, your vision is small,<br>    fantasize, imagine, dream, but don’t take advice,<br>    Let me tell you! This dream is our life!<br>    Now, Walk beside me, never let go of my hand!<br>    I’m here for you until the very end!<br><br></p>
